> Remind students to install Python, VS Code, and Jupyter Notebook.

> Have students open VS Code and .venv and check to see if the Python shell works.

### Python

* Programming language
* Popular for data analysis and visualization


### VS Code

* IDE - Integrated Development Environment (personalized)
    * Interpreter/Shell
    * Text editor
        * object highlighting 
        * information about problems with code
        * `tab` key autocompletes
            * Let the computer do repetitious work. 
            * It's easier and with fewer mistakes.
    * Environment/History
    * Project management

> Create a new folder for scripts

### Basic expressions

* Write code directly in Python shell
* Kangaroo rat weight (g -> lb)

```
50
50 / 1000
50 / 1000 * 2.2
```

* Write code in the text editor and run either by line or all code

```
50
50 / 1000
50 / 1000 * 2.2
```

* `Source` vs `Source with Echo`

> Create notes Python script, put in a new folder


### Variables

* A variable is a name that has a value associated with it
    * Assign using `<-` or `=`

```
weight_g <- 50
weight_g = 50
```

* It works just like the value itself

```
weight_g / 1000
weight_g / 1000 * 2.2
weight_lb <- weight_g / 1000 * 2.2
```

* It won't change unless you assign a new value to it directly

```
weight_g
weight_g * 2
weight_g
weight_g <- 26
weight_g
```

### Comments

* Remember what code is doing
* For humans, not computers
* Use the `#`

```
# Calculate weight of Kangaroo Rat in pounds
```

### Assignments format

* Comment before each problem and each sub-problem
* Make sure result prints out on `Source with echo`

```
# Problem 1

# 1.1
2 + 2

# 1.2
2 - 8

# Problem 2

width = 2
height = 3
length = 1.5
volume = width * height * length
volume
```

* Now we're going to work on some exercises to get a feel for this
* In class we will often only do part of an exercise and save the rest for later
* I use an in-class feedback system to get a feel for when most folks are done
  and how well folks understand the material
* When you are done with the part of the exersise we are doing for class, click
  on the `In class feedback` link and fill out the poll
* Two sections
  * 1-5 rating for how well you understand what we just covered
  * A text box to describe anything confusing you if you can describe it
  * 4 and 5's indicate that you're following things and we can move on
  * 3's and below suggest we need to chat more

### Functions

* A function is a complicated expression.
* Command that returns a value
* Hides the details of how that value is determined.
* Useful - don't want to know how numbers are rounded

```
sqrt(weight_lb)
sqrt(0.11)
```

* A function call is composed of two parts.
    * Name of the function
    * Arguments that the function requires to calculate the value it returns.
    * `sqrt()` is the name of the function, and `0.11` is the argument.

* Another function that we'll use a lot is `print()`
* It lets us explicitly print things out
* One argument - the thing you want to print

```
print(weight_lb)
```

* When we run the whole file using `Source` this value gets printed
* *Source w/o echo*
* Use this for output we want the program to produce
* Use this in your assignments to print out the answers

* Functions can take multiple arguments.
    * Round `weight_lb` to one decimal place
    * Typing `round()` shows arguments
    * Number to be rounded and number of digits

```
round(0.11, 1)
round(weight_lb, 1)
```

* Save the output of a function by assigning it to a variable

```
weight_rounded <- round(weight_lb, 1)
weight_rounded
```

> Do [Exercise 4.1-4.3 - Built-in Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-built-in-functions-R/)

* If you don't save the output of a function then there is no way to access it

```
mass_kg <- 0.5163
round(mass_kg, 2)
```

* It is common to forget this when dealing with variables and expect the
  variable to have changed

```
mass_kg
```

### Types

* All values have types

```
str(weight_lb)
str('hello world')
```
