### Step 1: Make sure we can help!

The [target audience]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/audience) of this course was started as university students taking course onsite and the materials you see here are built as the preview requirements before class and review/practice (exercises and exams) after class meetings. If you are a scientist at any educational level that works with data and you 1) want to learn the basics of programming or 2) want to establish a little more formal programming background and work-flow, then you are likely to benefit from this website by going through the course at your own pace. As we add more self-guided learning features to automate and optimize the modules in this course, you are welcome to take advantage of the improvements. 

### Step 2: Decide your approach to the course.

As a self-guided student, you can 1) follow along with the whole course at your own pace or 2) find a couple modules that will be helpful to you in isolation. 

1. If you are following the whole course, we suggest you follow the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule), which includes introductions into SQL and [R]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-r/). Each [assignment]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) includes listings for video and text materials, as well as the practice [exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises). We provide output files with each exercise to give you a hint what your code should accomplish.

2. If you are interested in just a couple of modules in SQL or R, the best way to find out the assignment that is best suited to your needs is browsing through the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule). 

*If you are interested in the Python material, the [lesson material]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/) and [assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/) developed in previous iterations of the course are still available, but with less direction.*
