This is a follow up to [Climate Space Rewrite]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Repro-climate-space-rewrite).

Using the functions you created in [Climate Space Rewrite]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Repro-climate-space-rewrite) iterate over the following list of species to create one plot per species from the list. Include a title for each plot that is the species name using the `ggtitle()` function. You can use any type of automated iteration that we've learned.

```
species <- c("Juniperus occidentalis", "Quercus alba", "Picea glauca", "Ceiba pentandra", "Quercus rubra", "Larrea tridentata", "Opuntia pusilla")
```
