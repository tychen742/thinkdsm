You are interested in studying the influence of the timing and length of small
scale flood events on an ecosystem. To do this you need to determine when floods
occurred and how long they lasted based on stream gauge data.

Download the
[stream guage data for USGS stream gauge site 02236000]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/st_johns_stream_data.csv)
on the St. Johns River in Florida. Find the continuous pieces of the time-series
where the stream level is above the flood threshold of 2.26 feet and store the
information on the start date and length of each flood in a data frame.
