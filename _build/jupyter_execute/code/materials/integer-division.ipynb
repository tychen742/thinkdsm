So, since 9 and 2 are both integers Python 2 returns 4 (i.e., it gets rid of the remainder of the division).\n",

If you're still using Python 2 (and most scientists still do because a lot of important scientific modules don't work in Python 3 yet) you can make it function in the way you'd expect by using a special command."
