    "For addition, use the plus sign. For multiplication, use the asterisk. Division is performed with a forward slash. Note that dividing two integers results in a floating point number. For exponents, use two asterisks together. Python follows the order of operations, and you can use parentheses to clarify the order.\n",

    "Strings in Python\n",
    "Strings can be created using single or double quotes. You can also wrap double quotes around single quotes if you need to include a quote inside the string.\n",
    "Python Code Sample\n",

    "Printing Strings and Print Formatting\n",
    "Assign a string to a variable and print it. In Jupyter Notebook, typing the variable name displays the value, but to officially display output in Python, use the print statement.\n",
    "Python Code Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 'hello'\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "Print Formatting with .format()\n",
    "You can format print statements by inserting curly brackets in your string and using the .format() method to fill them with variable values.\n",

    "num = 12\n",
    "name = 'Sam'\n",

    "print('My number is {one} and my name is {two}. More: {one}'.format(one=num, two=name))\n",
    "Indexing and Slicing Strings\n",
    "Strings are sequences of characters. You can access specific elements using square bracket notation. Python indexing starts at zero.\n",
    "Python Code Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "s = 'hello'\n",
    "s[0]\n",
    "s[4]\n",
    "Slice notation allows you to grab parts of a string. Use a colon to specify the start and end indices. The end index is not included.\n",
    "Python Code Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "s = 'abcdefghijk'\n",
    "s[0:]\n",
    "s[:3]\n",
    "s[3:6]\n",
    "Lists in Python\n",
    "Lists are sequences of elements in square brackets, separated by commas. Lists can contain any data type, including other lists.\n",
    "Python Code Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n",
    "my_list.append('d')\n",
    "my_list[0]\n",
    "my_list[1:3]\n",
    "my_list[0] = 'NEW'\n",
    "Lists can be nested inside each other. You can access elements in nested lists by chaining square brackets.\n",
    "Python Code Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "lst = [1, 2, [3, 4]]\n",
    "lst[2][1]\n",
    "For deeper nesting, continue stacking brackets to access the desired element.\n",
    "Python Code Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "nest = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, ['target']]]\n",
    "nest[3][2][0]\n",
    "print(nest[3][2][0])\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "In this lecture, we covered lists, slice notation, how to grab things from an index, strings, print formatting, basic variable assignments, and basic arithmetic.\n",
    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "* Python supports basic arithmetic operations and variable assignments using intuitive syntax.\n",
    "* Strings can be created with single or double quotes and support indexing and slicing.\n",
    "* Print formatting allows dynamic insertion of variables into strings using the .format() method.\n",
    "* Lists are ordered sequences that support indexing, slicing, appending, and nesting.\n"
