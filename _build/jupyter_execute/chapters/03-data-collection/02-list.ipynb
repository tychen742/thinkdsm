    "# Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are one of Python's most useful built-in type. In Python, a list is a **sequence**, meaning it is an ordered collection of items that can store multiple values in a single variable. Lists are extremely flexible because they can hold elements of different data types, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists, and they can be changed after creation by adding, removing, or modifying items. Like a string, a **list** is a sequence of values. In a string, the\n",
    "values are characters; in a list, they can be any type.\n",
    "The values in a list are called **elements**.\n",

    "- - **Ordered**\n",
    "  - Elements maintain the order in which they were added and can be accessed by index (starting at 0).\n",
    "- - **Mutable**\n",
    "  - You can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created.\n",
    "- - **Allows Duplicates**\n",
    "  - Lists can contain repeated values without restriction.\n",
    "- - **Dynamic Size**\n",
    "  - The length of a list can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.\n",
    "- - **Heterogeneous**\n",
