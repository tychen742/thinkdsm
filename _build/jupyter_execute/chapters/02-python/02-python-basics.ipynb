    "**Variables** are names that reference **objects** in memory. You create them with the assignment operator (the equal sign, e.g., x = 2) and can reassign them to different objects. Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores for readability, avoid starting names with digits or symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "**Object?** In Python, a variable is a symbolic name or label that refers to an object in memory. In Python, everything is an object. This includes numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, functions, classes, and even modules. An object is an instance of a class, which serves as a blueprint defining the object's attributes (data) and methods. Each object has a unique identity (memory address), a type (its class), and a value. (see [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python coding conventions)\n",

    "**Operators** let you perform common processing on variables. There are 7 main operators:\n",

    "2. arithmetic operators perform calculations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`) (note that / yields a floating-point and you usually can't divide by 0).\n",
    "3. comparison operators evaluate relationships (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).\n",
    "4. logical operators combine boolean expressions (`and`, `or`, `not`; e.g., `x == x and y > z`).\n",
    "5. bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`; e.g., `x & y`).\n",
    "6. identity operators compare the objects whereas the equality operator compare two values (`is`, `is not` (e.g., `a is b`)).\n",
    "7. membership operators (`in, not in` (`x in my_list)1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator **precedence**: Python follows standard mathematical order of operations (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, then Addition and Subtraction from left to right). For example:"

    "In this lecture, we covered lists, slice notation, how to grab things from an index, strings, print formatting, basic variable assignments, and basic arithmetic.\n",
    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python supports basic arithmetic operations and variable assignments using intuitive syntax.\n",
    "- Strings can be created with single or double quotes and support indexing and slicing.\n",
    "- Print formatting allows dynamic insertion of variables into strings using the .format() method.\n",
    "- Lists are ordered sequences that support indexing, slicing, appending, and nesting.\n",
