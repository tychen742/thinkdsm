    "# Jupyter Notebook: The IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks intensively in this course. Jupyter Notebook is an important part of the Python ecosystem and is widely used by the data science and machine learning community for its capability of combining code and notes together. As an alternative, you can use Google Colab, which is actually also Jupyter Notebook. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Jupyter Notebook system, including how to install it, how to use it effectively, and how to navigate its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "Some prefer to use Anaconda to manage Jupyter Notebook. We use the Python package installer ```pip``` for simplicity and better project control. The popular IDE VS Code can also run Jupyter Notebook, but the user experience is different and we will use Jupyter Notebook in this course.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to install and configure Jupyter Notebook is to create a Python virtual environment. To do that, we need to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) in the computer. To install and start using Jupyter Notebook, follow the four steps below: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Python\n",
    "2. Create Project directory\n",
    "3. Create and enable a Python virtual environment (.venv)\n",
    "4. Start Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Python installation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will use Python 3.12.2 because we want to use an autograder in Jupyter Notebook to give you instant feedback on your answer to the questions to help you with your learning. It is not uncommon for an OS to have multiple Python installations so you may install different versions of Python and the OS should handle that automatically. One thing we want to ensure happening is that we want the path of our target Python version to be added to the OS's environment variable ($PATH), which sometimes will require some attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Python for macOS\n",
    "If you are using macOS, you already have a version of Python shipped with the OS. You may issue the following commands in the command line (Terminal.app) to see the version of the current system default Python version.  \n",

    "For Windows OS users, Windows not ship with a Python by default. Since Python is widely used, your computer may have various versions of Python installed.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook system is a powerful tool for interactive coding and note-taking. Instead of using proprietary tools such as Tableau or PowerBI, it is now common for data scientists to use Python and Jupyter Notebook Remember that the notebook will start in your current directory, so use the cd command to navigate as needed.\n",

    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks allow for interactive Python coding and note-taking in one environment.\n",
    "- Use PowerShell or Terminal to launch Jupyter Notebooks and navigate directories as needed.\n",
    "- Code cells execute Python code, while markdown cells are for formatted notes and documentation.\n",
    "- Keyboard shortcuts like Shift+Enter and A, B, DD to streamline workflow in notebooks.\n",
    "- Notebooks can be saved, exported, and kernels restarted or interrupted for troubleshooting.\n",
