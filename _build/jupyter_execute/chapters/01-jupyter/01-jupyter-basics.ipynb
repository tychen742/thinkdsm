    "# Jupyter Notebook: The IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks intensively in this course. Jupyter Notebook is an important part of the Python ecosystem and is widely used by the data science and machine learning community for its capability of combining code and notes together. As an alternative, you can use Google Colab, which is actually also Jupyter Notebook. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Jupyter Notebook system, including how to install it, how to use it effectively, and how to navigate its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "Some prefer to use Anaconda to manage Jupyter Notebook. We use the Python package installer ```pip``` for simplicity and better project control. The popular IDE VS Code can also run Jupyter Notebook, but the user experience is different and we will use Jupyter Notebook in this course.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to install and configure Jupyter Notebook is to create a Python virtual environment. To do that, we need to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) in the computer. To install and start using Jupyter Notebook, follow the four steps below: \n",

    "## 1. Python installation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will use Python 3.12.2 because we want to use an autograder in Jupyter Notebook to give you instant feedback on your answer to the questions to help you with your learning. It is not uncommon for an OS to have multiple Python installations so you may install different versions of Python and the OS should handle that automatically. One thing we want to ensure happening is that we want the path of our target Python version to be added to the OS's environment variable ($PATH), which sometimes will require some attention.\n",

    "In general, when we create a project, it means we are creating a folder/directory. To use a project directory, we use the CLI of your OS. Since they are CLI rather than GUI, we need to use commands to achieve this. Although this can be done with a file manager (GUI), learning how to use the CLI helps in the long run. The three shell commands that we use here are: `ls` (\"list storage\"), `cd` (\"change directory\"), and `mkdir` (\"make directory\"). \n",

This means that we are going to place all packages (dependencies) we use in the virtual environment instead installing the dependencies in the system Python, which is prone to conflicts. To install the packages in the project virtual environment also means that we are making this environment portable, meaning we can replicate the dependencies in another project or device. In addition to the installed project, the virtual environment also contains a link to the desired Python. \n",

    "#### 6.5.1. Saving and Exporting Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save your notebook by clicking the save icon or pressing Ctrl+S. Jupyter Notebooks have an autosave feature that saves every two minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To export your notebook, go to File > Download As and select your preferred format, such as .py (\"Executable Script\") for Python scripts, PDF for documentation, or .html for web viewing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.5.2. Restarting and Interrupting the Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an infinite loop or need to restart your Python environment, go to the 'Kernel' menu and select 'Restart Kernel' (`0,0`). This will reset the notebook's kernel and stop any running code. You can also use 'Interrupt' (`I,I`) to stop a specific cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.5.3. Shutdown and Deactivate\n",
    "\n",
    "To shut down Jupyter Notebook safely, you need to 1) shut down the notebooks kernels and close the tabs, 2) quit the Notebook server, and 3) deactivate the Python virtual environment. \n",
    "- Shutdown the notebook kernels and close the notebooks: First, save your work, then stop individual notebooks’ kernels from the Notebook UI (Kernel → Shutdown or Shutdown All Kernels). The can also be done from the Dashboard’s “Running” tab. After that, close the browser tabs.\n",
    "- Stop the Notebook server: Stop the server process at the Home page by doing File → Shut Down. Alternatively, this can be done by pressing Ctrl+C (confirm when prompted).\n",
    "- Finally, at the CLI, enter `deactivate` to exit the active Python virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks allow for interactive Python coding and note-taking in one environment.\n",
    "- Use PowerShell or Terminal to launch Jupyter Notebooks and navigate directories as needed.\n",
    "- Code cells execute Python code, while markdown cells are for formatted notes and documentation.\n",
    "- Keyboard shortcuts like Shift+Enter and A, B, DD to streamline workflow in notebooks.\n",
    "- Notebooks can be saved, exported, and kernels restarted or interrupted for troubleshooting.\n",
