    "\n",
    "We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks intensively in this course. Jupyter Notebook is an important part of the Python ecosystem and is widely used by the data science and machine learning community for its capability of combining code and notes together. As an alternative, you can use Google Colab, which is actually also Jupyter Notebook. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Jupyter Notebook system, including how to install it, how to use it effectively, and how to navigate its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{note}\n",
    "Some prefer to use Anaconda to manage Jupyter Notebook. We use the Python package installer ```pip``` for simplicity and better project control. The popular IDE VS Code can also run Jupyter Notebook, but the user experience is different.\n",

    "## 1. Installing Jupyter Notebook\n",

    "To install and start using Jupyter Notebook, follow the four steps below.\n",

    "1. Check Python installation\n",
    "2. Create Project directory\n",

    "### 1.1. Check Python installation\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a macOS or Linux user, your OS has a version of Python installed already. You may issue `python` or `python3` to see the version of the system default Python version. The Windows OS, however, does not ship with a Python installed. There are two ways to install Python in Windows: through Windows Store or by downloading an installer from python.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have installed Python through the Windows Store:\n",
    "  - PATH environment variable: Your PATH environment variable will be set to this installation automatically.\n",
    "  - The \"py launcher\": However, the py.exe launcher, which provides a convenient way to manage and select different Python versions, will not be included when the Python installation.\n",
    "- If you chose to install Python by downloading a Python installer from python.org, you will have the opportunity to:\n",
    "  - Use admin privileges when installing py.exe, and\n",

    "### Restarting and Interrupting the Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter an infinite loop or need to restart your Python environment, go to the 'Kernel' menu and select 'Restart'. This will reset the notebook's kernel, stopping any running code. You can also use 'Interrupt' to stop a specific cell, though it may not always work with problematic loops.\n",

    "\n",
    "The 'Help' menu provides documentation for libraries and the notebook itself. You can also find a list of keyboard shortcuts under Help > Keyboard Shortcuts.\n",

    "### Code and Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a markdown cell, change the cell type from 'Code' to 'Markdown'. Markdown cells are useful for taking notes and support formatting such as headings, bold, italics, bullet points, and even LaTeX for equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code is not running, ensure the cell is set to 'Code' and not 'Markdown'. To switch, select the cell and change its type accordingly.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook system is a powerful tool for interactive coding and note-taking. Instead of using proprietary tools such as Tableau or PowerBI, it is now common for data scientists to use Python and Jupyter Notebook Remember that the notebook will start in your current directory, so use the cd command to navigate as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks allow for interactive Python coding and note-taking in one environment.\n",
    "- Use PowerShell or Terminal to launch Jupyter Notebooks and navigate directories as needed.\n",
    "- Code cells execute Python code, while markdown cells are for formatted notes and documentation.\n",
    "- Keyboard shortcuts like Shift+Enter and A, B, DD to streamline workflow in notebooks.\n",
    "- Notebooks can be saved, exported, and kernels restarted or interrupted for troubleshooting.\n",
