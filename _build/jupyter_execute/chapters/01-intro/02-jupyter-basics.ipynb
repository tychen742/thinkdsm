    "# Jupyter Notebook Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use Jupyter Notebooks intensively in this course. Jupyter Notebook is an important part of the Python ecosystem and is widely used by the data science and machine learning community for its capability of combining code and notes together. As an alternative, you can use Google Colab, which is actually also Jupyter Notebook. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Jupyter Notebook system, including how to install it, how to use it effectively, and how to navigate its environment.\n",

    "````{note}\n",
    "Some prefer to use Anaconda to manage Jupyter Notebook. We use the Python package installer ```pip``` for simplicity and better project control. The popular IDE VS Code can also run Jupyter Notebook, but the user experience is different and we will use Jupyter Notebook in this course.\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to install and configure Jupyter Notebook is to create a Python virtual environment. To do that, we need to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) in the computer. To install and start using Jupyter Notebook, follow the four steps below: \n",

    "In this course, we will use Python 3.12.2 because we want to use an autograder in Jupyter Notebook to give you some instant feedback on your answers to some of the questions. It is not uncommon for an OS to have multiple Python installations so you may install different versions of Python in your computer. \n",

    "- Shutdown the notebook kernels and close the notebooks: First, save your work, then stop individual notebooks’ kernels from the Notebook UI (Kernel → Shutdown or Shutdown All Kernels). The can also be done from the Dashboard’s “Running” tab. After that, close the browser tabs.\n",
    "- Stop the Notebook server: Stop the server process at the Home page by doing File → Shut Down. Alternatively, this can be done by pressing Ctrl+C (confirm when prompted).\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks allow for interactive Python coding and note-taking in one environment.\n",
    "- Use PowerShell or Terminal to launch Jupyter Notebooks and navigate directories as needed.\n",
    "- Code cells execute Python code, while markdown cells are for formatted notes and documentation.\n",
    "- Keyboard shortcuts like Shift+Enter and A, B, DD to streamline workflow in notebooks.\n",
    "- Notebooks can be saved, exported, and kernels restarted or interrupted for troubleshooting.\n",
