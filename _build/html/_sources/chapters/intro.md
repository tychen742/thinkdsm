# Introduction

These lecture notes are prepared for IST-3420, Introduction to Data Science and Management at Missouri University of Science and Technology (MS&T). The course aims to provide you with a solid foundation in data science concepts and practices, supporting both your future studies and career development.

Major curriculum modules included in this course are:

- Foundation Building: Establishes solid Python/Jupyter programming skills essential for data science work.
- Data Manipulation Core: Covers NumPy and Pandas extensively, as these are the backbone tools for data scientists.
- Visualization Skills: Develops both basic and advanced visualization capabilities for effective data communication.
- Analysis Techniques (Weeks 9-10): Introduces statistical thinking and hypothesis testing crucial for data-driven insights.
- Machine Learning (Weeks 11-13): Covers both supervised and unsupervised learning with practical implementations.

## What is data science?

According to [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/topics/research/data-science.html), data Science is "a field of study that uses scientific methods, processes, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data." As the Data Science Venn Diagram suggested by [Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), data science is by nature interdisciplinary. Its practitioners draw on varied training in statistics, computing, and domain expertise.

## The data science process

As general process model of conducting a data science, the CRoss Industry Standard Process for data mining, known as [CRISP-DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining#cite_note-Shearer00-1), is widely used as a defacto standard to describe the common approaches used for data mining and data science analytics. In the industry, practitioners create their own process models based on the CRISP-DM process model. For example, the right figure below is a general data science lifecycle model with added EDA process.
