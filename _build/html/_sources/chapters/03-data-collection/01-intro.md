# Intro to Data Collections

Python’s data collections are the built‑in container types you use to store, organize, and operate on groups of values: 
- sequences like list (mutable) and tuple (immutable) for ordered items,
- dict for key–value mappings, and 
- set/frozenset for unordered unique items

Python data collections let you: 
- model data naturally (ordered records, lookup tables, unique elements), 
- support iteration and common algorithms,
- use methods for adding, removing, searching, and transforming data.
